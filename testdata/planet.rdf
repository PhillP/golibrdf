<p>The 5th <a href=
"http://aksw.org/Events/2013/LeipzigerSemanticWebTag.html" target=

a meeting point for german as well as international Linked Data
experts. Under the motto: From Big Data to Smart Data sophisticated
methods that enable handling large amounts of data have been
presented on September 23th in Leipzig. The keynote was held by
Hans Uszkoreit, scientific director at the German Research Center
for Artificial Intelligence (DFKI). By being introduced &#160;to
Text Analytics and Big Data issues the participants of the LSWT
2013 discussed the intelligent usage of huge amounts of data in the
web.</p>
<p>Presentations on industrial and scientific solutions showed
working solutions to big data concerns. Companies like Empolis,
Brox and Ontos presented Linked Data and Semantic Web solutions
capable of handling terabytes of data. However, also traditional
approaches, like Datameer’s Data Analytics Solution based on Hadoop
pointed out that big data could be handled nowadays without bigger
problems.</p>
<p>Furthermore, problems detecting topics in massive data streams
(Topic/S), document collections (WisARD) or corpora at information
service providers (Wolters Kluwer) were tackled. Even the ethical
issue of robots replacing journalists by the help of semantic data
has been examined by Alexander Siebert from Retresco.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the analysis of textual information in large
amounts of data is an interesting and so far not yet fully solved
area of work. Further Information are available from

  <description>The RDF Working Group and the JSON-LD Community Group published the Candidate Recommendation of JSON-LD 1.0 , and JSON-LD 1.0 Processing Algorithms and API . This signals the beginning of the call for implementations for JSON-LD 1.0. JSON-LD harmonizes the representation of Linked Data in JSON by describing a common JSON representation format for expressing directed graphs; mixing both Linked Data and non-Linked Data in a single document. The syntax is designed to not disturb already deployed systems running on JSON, but provide a smooth upgrade path from JSON to JSON-LD. It is primarily intended to be a way to ...</description>

"http://www.linkedin.com/pub/bruno-eugster/29/335/b43" target=

Switzerland</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Blumauer</strong>: How do semantic technologies fit into
your overall strategy, do you believe they are ‘the next big
thing’?</p>
<p><strong>Eugster</strong>: DTI AG focuses on projects to improve
information access and search, where semantic technologies play an
ever important role. In this respect, semantic technologies are one
of the next “big things”. Only if computers will understand crawled
content, as well as the needs of the information seeker, the user
will be able to get the right information in time. This is the key
challenge which semantic technology will help to meet.</p>
<p><strong>Blumauer</strong>: Which kind of projects in the field
of semantic technologies do you mainly support? What are the
business cases in such projects?</p>
<p><strong>Eugster</strong>: Everywhere where information workers
drive customer’s business, semantic technologies are of great help
to get precise hits in time. This is the case for DTI’s projects in
the sectors of enterprise search, knowledge management, eDiscovery,
legal investigations as well as in government, pharma, finance, and
insurance industry.</p>
<p><strong>Blumauer</strong>: How do your customers benefit from
PoolParty technologies? Why did you decide to develop a partnership
with Semantic Web Company?</p>
<p><strong>Eugster</strong>: In our days, where loads of
information dislocated in countless data silos, it’s enormously
important to bring already pre-filtered information to the
employee’s desk. As each employee has it’s own requirements to
given information – depending on his role and job. PoolParty allows
to enrich the information with these contexts. At DTI AG,&#160; we
have found a dynamic and innovative technology partner with
PoolParty, to achieve customer demands in information access and
search.</p>

<p>Bruno Eugster is founder of DTI AG which is an independent

<div>Last Thursday, there was a <a href=
"https://twitter.com/UM_Library">UM library</a> network drink. And
as I see a library where knowledge is found, and libraries still
rarely think of knowledge as ever being able to be stored outside
books and papers, I was happy to see the library promoting the
<a href="https://www.dataverse.nl/dvn/">Dutch Dataverse
Network</a>. So, I had to try it, and see if it fulfilled my basic
needs:<br />
<br />
<ol>
<li>shows under what conditions people can download, modify, and
redistribute data;</li>
<li>has a high visibility on the web; and</li>
<li>it is <a href="http://thedata.org/">open source</a>&#160;and
developed by <a href=
"https://twitter.com/thedataorg">@thedataorg</a>.</li>
</ol>
<div>And it does: and here is the v13.5 data behind <a href=
"http://www.jcheminf.com/content/5/1/23">the ChEMBL-RDF
paper</a>&#160;(which you can also query via <a href=
"http://rdf.farmbio.uu.se/chembl/sparql">this SPARQL end point</a>
at <a href="https://twitter.com/UU_University">Uppsala
University</a>):</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">
<a href=
"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-I1nrjXk2GTE/UiHbhetNB7I/AAAAAAAACA4/S_FmfsI0Sqw/s1600/dvn.png"
style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0"

width="400" alt="" /></a></div>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">
<br /></div>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">Now,
<a href="https://twitter.com/Chris_Evelo">Chris Evelo</a> wondered
about the purpose of this. Can we import the data in analysis
platforms? How does it related to efforts our group is involved in,
like <a href="http://dbnp.org/">dbNP</a> etc?</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>Well, my primary reasons for doing the above was to test the
system and to serve more than 700MB of RDF triples. Thus, with the
testing of the system done, the question now is, can we use it in
data analysis platforms. I found <a href=
"http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/dvn/">this R package</a>
by&#160;<span style="background-color: white;"><a href=
"http://thomasleeper.com/software.html">Thomas J. Leeper</a>. It
has several methods, some of which are given in the below example
code:</span></div>
<div><span style="background-color: white;"><br /></span></div>
<div><span style="background-color: white;"><span style=
"font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">search =
dvSearch(</span></span></div>
<div><span style="background-color: white;"><span style=
"font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">&#160;
dv="https://www.dataverse.nl/dvn/",</span></span></div>
<div><span style="background-color: white;"><span style=
"font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">&#160;
list(authorName="willighagen")</span></span></div>
<div><span style="background-color: white;"><span style=
"font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">)</span></span></div>
<div><span style="background-color: white;"><br /></span></div>
<div><span style="background-color: white;">This shows us the
handle of my one and currently only data set,&#160;</span><a href=
"http://hdl.handle.net/10411/10279">hdl:10411/10279</a>. We need
some further information, such as the formats of the records
metadata:</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div><span style=
"font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">formats =
dvMetadataFormats(</span></div>
<div><span style=
"font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">&#160;
dv="https://www.dataverse.nl/dvn/",</span></div>
<div><span style=
"font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">&#160;
search$objectid[1]</span></div>
<div><span style=
"font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">)</span></div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>When we combine this, we can retrieve the metadata:</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div><span style=
"font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">metadata =
dvMetadata(</span></div>
<div><span style=
"font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">&#160;
dv="https://www.dataverse.nl/dvn/",</span></div>
<div><span style=
"font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">&#160;
search$objectid[1],</span></div>
<div><span style=
"font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">&#160;
format.type=formats$formatName[1]</span></div>
<div><span style=
"font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">)</span></div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>Now, the package then has a&#160;dvExtractFileIds() method to
extract the file names. But the metadata for my record is not
compatible, and you need this code instead (and this has likely to
do with me not knowing the Dataverse system in enough detail to use
it properly):</div>
<div><br /></div>
<br />
<div>
<div><span style=
"font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">extractOtherMatFileIds
= function (xml)&#160;</span></div>
<div><span style=

<div><span style=

<div><span style=

<div><span style=

names(d) &lt;- c("fileName", "fileId", "level", "URI")</span></div>
<div><span style=
"font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">&#160; &#160; for
(i in 1:length(dscrs)) {</span></div>
<div><span style=
"font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">&#160; &#160;
&#160; &#160; attrs &lt;- xmlAttrs(dscrs[[i]])</span></div>
<div><span style=
"font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">&#160; &#160;
&#160; &#160; d$fileName[i] &lt;-
xmlValue(xmlChildren(dscrs[[i]])$labl)</span></div>
<div><span style=
"font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">&#160; &#160;
&#160; &#160; d$level[i] &lt;- attrs[names(attrs) ==

<div><span style=

<div><br /></div>
<div>So that, similar to <a href=

<div><br /></div>
<br />
<div>We are now ready to download the data, but, except for

<div><br /></div>
<div>However, this does not return the data file, but a HTML page
that allows one to accept the terms of use. Of course, we can use
the browser option in several of the methods, but any user
interaction makes downloading data in a workflow setting
unrealistic.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>Now, it should be able to automate that, not? We should be
able to instruct the dvn package and the Dataverse network to
always accept Creative Commons licenses, right?</div>

  <title>The Dutch Dataverse Network: a host for the ChEMBL-RDF v13.5
data, and some thoughts in workflow integration</title>

<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>
<div>Last Thursday, there was a <a href=
"https://twitter.com/UM_Library">UM library</a> network drink. And
as I see a library where knowledge is found, and libraries still
rarely think of knowledge as ever being able to be stored outside
books and papers, I was happy to see the library promoting the
<a href="https://www.dataverse.nl/dvn/">Dutch Dataverse
Network</a>. So, I had to try it, and see if it fulfilled my basic
needs:<br />
<br />
<ol>
<li>shows under what conditions people can download, modify, and
redistribute data;</li>
<li>has a high visibility on the web; and</li>
<li>it is <a href="http://thedata.org/">open source</a>&#160;and
developed by <a href=
"https://twitter.com/thedataorg">@thedataorg</a>.</li>
</ol>
<div>And it does: and here is the v13.5 data behind <a href=
"http://www.jcheminf.com/content/5/1/23">the ChEMBL-RDF
paper</a>&#160;(which you can also query via <a href=
"http://rdf.farmbio.uu.se/chembl/sparql">this SPARQL end point</a>
at <a href="https://twitter.com/UU_University">Uppsala
University</a>):</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">
<a href=

<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">
<br /></div>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">Now,
<a href="https://twitter.com/Chris_Evelo">Chris Evelo</a> wondered
about the purpose of this. Can we import the data in analysis
platforms? How does it related to efforts our group is involved in,
like <a href="http://dbnp.org/">dbNP</a> etc?</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>Well, my primary reasons for doing the above was to test the
system and to serve more than 700MB of RDF triples. Thus, with the
testing of the system done, the question now is, can we use it in
data analysis platforms. I found <a href=
"http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/dvn/">this R package</a>
by&#160;<span style="background-color: white;"><a href=
"http://thomasleeper.com/software.html">Thomas J. Leeper</a>. It
has several methods, some of which are given in the below example
code:</span></div>
<div><span style="background-color: white;"><br /></span></div>
<div><span style="background-color: white;"><span style=
"font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">search =
dvSearch(</span></span></div>
<div><span style="background-color: white;"><span style=
"font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">&#160;
dv="https://www.dataverse.nl/dvn/",</span></span></div>
<div><span style="background-color: white;"><span style=
"font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">&#160;
list(authorName="willighagen")</span></span></div>
<div><span style="background-color: white;"><span style=
"font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">)</span></span></div>
<div><span style="background-color: white;"><br /></span></div>
<div><span style="background-color: white;">This shows us the
handle of my one and currently only data set,&#160;</span><a href=
"http://hdl.handle.net/10411/10279">hdl:10411/10279</a>. We need
some further information, such as the formats of the records
metadata:</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div><span style=
"font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">formats =
dvMetadataFormats(</span></div>
<div><span style=
"font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">&#160;
dv="https://www.dataverse.nl/dvn/",</span></div>
<div><span style=
"font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">&#160;
search$objectid[1]</span></div>
<div><span style=
"font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">)</span></div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>When we combine this, we can retrieve the metadata:</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div><span style=
"font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">metadata =
dvMetadata(</span></div>
<div><span style=
"font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">&#160;
dv="https://www.dataverse.nl/dvn/",</span></div>
<div><span style=
"font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">&#160;
search$objectid[1],</span></div>
<div><span style=
"font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">&#160;
format.type=formats$formatName[1]</span></div>
<div><span style=
"font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">)</span></div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>Now, the package then has a&#160;dvExtractFileIds() method to
extract the file names. But the metadata for my record is not
compatible, and you need this code instead (and this has likely to
do with me not knowing the Dataverse system in enough detail to use
it properly):</div>
<div><br /></div>
<br />
<div>
<div><span style=
"font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">extractOtherMatFileIds
= function (xml)&#160;</span></div>
<div><span style=
"font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">{</span></div>
<div><span style=
"font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">&#160; &#160; nodes
&lt;- xmlChildren(xmlChildren(xmlParse(xml))$codeBook)</span></div>
<div><span style=
"font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">&#160; &#160; dscrs
&lt;- nodes[names(nodes) == "otherMat"]</span></div>
<div><span style=
"font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">&#160; &#160; d
&lt;- data.frame(matrix(nrow = length(dscrs), ncol =
4))&#160;</span></div>
<div><span style=
"font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">&#160; &#160;
names(d) &lt;- c("fileName", "fileId", "level", "URI")</span></div>
<div><span style=
"font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">&#160; &#160; for
(i in 1:length(dscrs)) {</span></div>
<div><span style=
"font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">&#160; &#160;
&#160; &#160; attrs &lt;- xmlAttrs(dscrs[[i]])</span></div>
<div><span style=
"font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">&#160; &#160;
&#160; &#160; d$fileName[i] &lt;-
xmlValue(xmlChildren(dscrs[[i]])$labl)</span></div>
<div><span style=
"font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">&#160; &#160;
&#160; &#160; d$level[i] &lt;- attrs[names(attrs) ==
"level"]</span></div>
<div><span style=
"font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">&#160; &#160;
&#160; &#160; d$URI[i] &lt;- attrs[names(attrs) ==
"URI"]</span></div>
<div><span style=
"font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">&#160; &#160;
&#160; &#160; d$fileId[i] &lt;- strsplit(d$URI[i],
"fileId=")[[1]][2]</span></div>
<div><span style=
"font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">&#160; &#160;
}</span></div>
<div><span style=
"font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">&#160; &#160;
return(d)</span></div>
<div><span style=
"font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">}</span></div>
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>So that, similar to <a href=
"http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/dvn/dvn.pdf">the dvn
package help PDF</a>, we can continue with:</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div><span style=
"font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">files =
extractOtherMatFileIds(metadata)</span></div>
<div><span style=
"font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">info &lt;-
dvDownloadInfo(</span></div>
<div><span style=

files$fileId[1]</span></div>
<div><span style=
"font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">)</span></div>
<div><br /></div>
<br />
<div>We are now ready to download the data, but, except for
<a href="https://github.com/leeper/dvn/pull/4">a small bug in the
package</a>, we run into a wall:</div>
<div><br /></div>
